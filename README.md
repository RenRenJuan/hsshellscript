# [MCP shhs](https://eg.meansofproduction.biz/eg/index.php/MCP-CMS)
<span style="font-size: 12px">Divergence from original devloper's pkg</span>

> Like shcl, this pkg's author emulates a generic shell, this time in haskell.

However in this case this is deemed more apropos the lang, and no attempt will be
made to bring it closer to actual mcpcms but some features of DCP/MCP will be 
added.  


## 1.0.0
   
 Command line executable developed analogous to shcl and upsh.
