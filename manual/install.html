<H2>Building and Installing HsShellScript</H2>

<p>HsShellScript is cabalized, which means that building and installing is a
  matter of some calls to <tt>cabal</tt>. However, it also provides a
  Makefile, which further simplifies the installation.

<p>In order to install, unpack the source distribution somewhere. Go to the
  directory, and call <tt>make</tt>. This will compile the library. If you want
  to install it locally, in your user account, then do <tt>make
  install-user</tt>. This calls <tt>cabal install --user</tt>. If you want to
  install the library globally, do <tt>make install-global</tt>. You will be
  prompted for the root password, which is needed in this case. This
  calls <tt>sudo cabal install --global</tt>.

<p>If installed as a user package, then the location of the API documentation
  is <tt>~/.cabal/share/doc/hsshellscript-3.3.1/html/index.html</tt>. If it is
  installed globaly, it
  is <tt>/usr/local/share/doc/hsshellscript-3.3.1/html/index.html</tt>. 

<p>Cabal's Simple Build Infrastructure doesn't provide any means to add extra
  documenation to a project. Therefore the user manual isn't installed by default.
  If you need it, you can just copy the "manual" directory anywhere you like,
  but the Makefile privides
  the make target <tt>install-manual</tt>, which copies the files to
  <tt>/usr/local/share/hsshellscript/manual</tt>.
