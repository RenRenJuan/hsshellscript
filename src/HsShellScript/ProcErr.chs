-- Execute an IO action as a separate process, and wait for it to finish.
-- Report errors as exceptions.
--
-- This forks a child process, which performs the specified IO action. In case
-- the child process has been stopped by a signal, the parent blocks.
--
-- If the action throws an @IOError@, it is transmitted to the parent.
-- It is then raised there, as if it happened locally. The child then aborts
-- quietly with an exit code of 0.
--
-- Exceptions in the child process, other than @IOError@s, result in an error
-- message on @stderr@, and a @ProcessStatus@ exception in the parent, with the
-- value of @Exited (ExitFailure 1)@. The following exceptions are understood by
-- @subproc@, and result in corresponding messages: @ArgError@, @ProcessStatus@,
-- @RunError@, @IOError@ and @ExitCode@. Other exceptions result in the generic
-- message, as produced by @show@.
--
-- If the child process exits with an exit code other than zero, or it is
-- terminated by a signal, the corresponding @ProcessStatus@ is raised as an
-- exception in the parent program. Only @IOError@s are transmitted to the parent.
--
-- When used in conjunction with an @exec@ variant, this means that the parent
-- process can tell the difference between failure of the @exec@ call itself,
-- and failure of the child program being executed after a successful call of
-- the @exec@ variant. In case of failure of the @exec@
-- call, You get the @IOError@, which
-- happened in the child when calling @executeFile@ (from the GHC hierarchical
-- libraries). In case of the called program failing, you get the @ProcessStatus@.
--
-- Unless you replace the child process, calling an @exec@ variant, the child
-- should let the control flow leave the action normally (unless it throws an
-- @IOError@). The child process is then properly terminated by @subproc@, such
-- that no resources, which have been duplicated by the fork, cause problems.
-- See "HsShellScript#subr" for details.
--
-- If you want to run an external program, by calling one of the @exec@
-- variants in the child action, you might want to call @runprog@ instead of @subproc@.
--
--
-- Examples:
--
-- Run a program with the environment replaced:
--
-- >subproc (execpe "foobar" ["1","2","3"] new_env)
--
-- This results in a @ProcessStatus@ exception:
--
-- >subproc (exec "/bin/false" [])
--
-- This results in an @IOError@ (unless you actually have @\/frooble@):
--
-- >subproc (exec "/frooble" [])
--
-- See 'runprog', 'spawn', 'exec', 'execp', 'exece', 'execpe'.

   to the standard input of @q@ through a pipe. The result action consists
   of forking off @p@ (connected with a pipe), and @q@.

   The result action does /not/ run @q@ in a separate process. So, the pipe
   itself can be seen as a modified action @q@, forking a connected @p@.
   The pipe is called \"right
   handed\", because @q@ has this property, and not @p@.

   /The exit code of p is silently ignored./ The process ID of the forked
   copy of @q@ isn't returned to the caller, so it's lost.

   The pipe, which connects @p@ and @q@, is in /text mode/. This means that the 
   output of @p@ is converted from Unicode to the system character set, which 
   is determined by the environment variable @LANG@.

-- exits in a way which indicates an error).
--
-- When the child action exits in a way which indicates an error, the
-- corresponding @ProcessStatus@ is thrown. See
-- 'System.Posix.Process.getProcessStatus'.
-- No attempt is made to create
-- more meaningful exceptions, like it is done by @runprog@/@subproc@.
--
--
-- Exceptions in the action result in an error message on @stderr@, and the
-- proper termination of the child. This means that the error message is sent
-- through the pipe, to the parent process. The message can be found in the text
-- which has been read from the child process. It doesn't appear on the console.
--
-- The parent gets a @ProcessStatus@ exception, with
-- the value of @Exited (ExitFailure 1)@. The following exceptions are
-- understood, and result in corresponding messages: @ArgError@,
-- @ProcessStatus@, @RunError@, @IOError@ and @ExitCode@. Other exceptions
-- result in the generic message, as produced by @show@.
--
-- Unless you replace the child process, calling an @exec@ variant, the child
-- should let the control flow leave the action normally. The child process is
-- then properly terminated, such that no resources, which have been duplicated
-- by the fork, cause problems. See "HsShellScript#subr" for details.
--
-- Unlike shells\' backquote feature, @pipe_from2@ does not remove any trailing
-- newline characters. The entire error output of the action is returned. You might want
-- to apply @chomp@ to the result.
--
-- The pipe is set to /text mode/. This means that the Unicode characters in the
-- text, which is read from stdin, is converted from the system character set to
-- Unicode. The system character set is determined by the environment variable
-- @LANG@. If you need to read binary data from the forked process, you should use
-- @h_pipe_from@ and set the returned handle to binary mode. This is

   Call the shell to execute a command. In case of an error, throw the @ProcessStatus@ (such as @(Exited (ExitFailure ec))@) as an exception.
   This is like the Haskell standard library function @system@, except that error handling is brought in accordance with HsShellScript\'s scheme.

   @exitcode . system_throw@ is the same as the @system@ function, except that when the called shell is terminated or stopped by a signal, this still
   lead to the @ProcessStatus@ being thrown. The Haskell library report says nothing about what happens in this case, when using the
   @system@ function.

>system_throw cmd = run "/bin/sh" ["-c", "--", cmd]

   This function is deprecated. You should rather use 'system_runprog', which provides for much better error reporting.

{- | Run a subroutine as a child process, but don't let it produce any messages.
Read its @stdout@ and @stderr@ instead, and append it to the contents of a
mutable variable. The idea is that you can run some commands silently, and
report them and their messages to the user only when something goes wrong.

If the child process terminates in a way which indicates an error, then the
process status is thrown, in the same way as 'runprog' does. If the subroutine
throws an @(Exited ec)@ exception (of type @ProcessStatus@), such as thrown by
'runprog', then the child process exits with the same exit code, such that the
parent process reports it to the caller, again as a @ProcessStatus@ exception.

When the subroutine finishes, the child process is terminated with @'_exit' 0@.
When it throws an exception, an error message is printed and it is terminated
with @'_exit' 1@. See "HsShellScript#subr" for details.

The standard output (and the standard error output) of the parent process are
flushed before the fork, such that no output appears twice.

Example:

>let handler :: IORef String -> ProcessStatus -> IO ()
>    handler msgref ps = do hPutStrLn stderr ("Command failed with " ++ show ps ++ ". Actions so far: ")
>                           msg <- readIORef msgref
>                           hPutStrLn stderr msg
>                           exitWith (ExitFailure 1)
>
>msgref <- newIORef ""
>do silently msgref $ do putStrLn "Now doing foobar:"
>                        echo exec "/foo/bar" ["arguments"]
>   silently msgref $ echo exec "/bar/baz" ["arguments"]
>`catch` (handler msgref)

{- | This is a replacement for @System.Posix.Process.executeFile@. It does
   additional preparations, then calls @executeFile@. @executeFile@ /can't normally/
   /be used directly, because it doesn't do the things which are/
   /outlined here./

   This are the differences to @executeFile@:

   1. @stdout@ and @stderr@ are flushed.

   2. The standard file descriptors 0-2 are made copies of the file descriptors
   which the standard handles currently use. This is necessary because they
   might no longer use the standard handles. See "HsShellScript#fdpipes".

   If the standard handles @stdin@, @stdout@, @stderr@ aren't in closed state,
   and they aren't already connected to the respective standard file
   descriptors, their file descriptors are copied to the respective standard
   file descriptors (with @dup2@). Backup copies are made of the file
   descriptors which are overwritten. If some of the standard handles are closed,
   the corresponding standard file descriptors are closed as well.

   3. All file descriptors, except for the standard ones, are set to close-on-exec
   (see @fcntl(2)@), and will be closed on successful replacement of
   the process. Before that, the old file descriptor flags are saved.

   4. The standard file descriptors are set to blocking mode, since GHC 6.2.2
   sets file descriptors to non-blocking (except 0-2, which may get
   overwritten by a non-blocking one in step 2). The called program
   doesn't expect that.

   5. In case replacing the process fails, the file descriptors are reset to
   the original state. The file descriptors flags are restored, and the file
   descriptors 0-2 are overwritten again, with their backup copies. Then an
   IOError is thrown.

   6. In any IOError, the program is filled in as the file name (@executeFile@
   neglects this).

   7. The return type is a generic @a@, rather than @()@.

{- About Bas van Dijk's unsafeWithHandleFd:

   This function is broken. It blocks when called like this:

   -- Blocks
   unsafeWithHandleFd stdout $ \fd ->
      putStrLn ("stdout: fd = " ++ show fd)

   The job of unsafeWithHandleFd's job is, to keep a reference to
   the handle, so it won't be garbage collected, while the action is still
   running. Garbage collecting the handle would close it, as well as the
   underlying file descriptor, while the latter is still in use by the action.
   This can't happen as long as use of the file descriptor is encapsulated in the
   action.

   This encapsulation can be circumvented by returning the file descriptor, and
   that's what I do in execute_file. This should usually not be done.

   However, I want to use it on stdin, stdout and stderr, only. These three
   should never be garbage collected. Under this circumstances, it should be
   safe to use unsafeWithHandleFd this way.
